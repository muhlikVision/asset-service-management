Asset Service Management System is a blockchain application that is focused on assisting the
IT industry with the procurement of technological resources for their need. This application
helps companies to request laptops from an asset service management company. This
eliminates the need to have an IT department of their own, saving a lot of recurring cost on
maintenance. This also helps the companies since they don’t need to spend a lot on initial
investment in buying these laptops. The asset management companies give the assets on rent
for a period of time based on a company’s requirement. These assets once returned back can
be further passed on to other companies. The blockchain application ensures a secure and
invulnerable platform that guarantees tamper-free history of the asset.
